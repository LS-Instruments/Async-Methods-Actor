# Async-Methods-Actor
A library that extends the Actor Framework to allow for async method execution.

Actor based library that implements an infrastructure for launching async methods. By making actors inherit from the "Async Methods Actor", it is possible to launch any method without waiting for its conclusion, by sending messages child of the abstract message "Async Message.lvclass". This framework is especially useful for tasks that take a long time to execute which implemented as Actor methods would lock the actor until completion. The official way to implement those tasks in the Actor Framework is that of coding them as helper loops within the "Actor Core.vi". This however brings along the overhead of setting up a communication mechanism between Actor methods and the helper loop, thus voiding the advantage of OOP encapsulation. By means of this framework, you continue to benefit from OOP encapsulation of the Actor Framework also for long execution tasks without having to implement ad-hoc data transfer methods between methods and helper loops.
