This set of examples is exactly the same as the one in the folder ../Async Methods Actor Example the only difference being that the example is linked to the code installed by the VIPM package. This is needed to be able to generate messages by means of the LSI AF Message Maker who is linked to the Async Methods Actors VIPM Package.

The workflow for updating the example is as follows
1. Work on the code within this derectory making sure that a premliminary version of the Async Methods Actors package incorporating the new developments is installed
2. Uninstall the Async Methods Actors VIPM package
3. Copy the code in the ../Async Methods Actor Example
4. Open the code therein relinking the Async Methods Actors to the non git source
